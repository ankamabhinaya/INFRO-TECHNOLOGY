This project is designed to protect sensitive files by encrypting them with a password. Encryption ensures that only authorized users can access the file. Even if someone gets the file, they won’t be able to open it without the correct password.
 How It Works
1. Select or Drag & Drop a File – Choose a file to encrypt.
2. Enter a Password – The system locks the file using a secure encryption method.
3. File Gets Encrypted – A new encrypted file is created (e.g., document.txt.enc).
4. Decryption (Unlocking the File)

* Select the encrypted file.
* Enter the correct password.
* The system restores the original file.
